<h2> Research </h2>

<h3> Graduate Student Researcher in Hillel Adesnik’s Lab @ UC Berkeley<br />May 2013 – present</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Identifying how neurons in the barrel cortex of mice represent the location of an object in its whisking field, and determining how these representations rely on multi-whisker integration and transform across the cortical layers </li>
	<li>Managed and optimized a two-photon microscope, and worked with the vendor on new features and fixing bugs</li>
	<li>Set-up and managed a large Linux server to store and secure the hundreds of TBs of data generated in the lab </li>
	<li>Prepared mice to express GCaMP6s, implanted chronic cranial windows, and collected neural activity data </li>
	<li>Developed an image analysis pipeline to identify neurons in a semi-automated fashion and pull out their activity </li>
	<li>Analyzed large, self-generated datasets and discovered multiple novel features of barrel cortex computation </li>
</ul>
<h3> Research Assistant in Lydia Sohn’s Lab @ UC Berkeley<br />May 2011 – Jun 2012</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Analyzed spatial organization of cell surface receptors in breast cancer as it correlates to different microenvironments of the cancer using Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) </li>
	<li>Helped iterate and build dual channel microscope that has ability to perform TIRF, phase-contrast, and STORM </li>
	<li>Designed image analysis software, prepared cell cultures and buffers, and collected and analyzed STORM data </li>
</ul>
<h3>Research Assistant in Austin Roorda’s Lab @ UC Berkeley<br />May 2010 – Sep 2011</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Validated ability of the Adaptive Optics and Scanning Laser Ophthalmascope to identify retinal pathologies, and developed metric to objectively identify macular cone loss using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography </li>
	<li>Registered and processed AOSLO data, and then correlated regions of photoreceptor droupout with SDOCT </li>
</ul>
